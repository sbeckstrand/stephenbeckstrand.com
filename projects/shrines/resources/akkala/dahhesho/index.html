    <p>Location: South East of Akkala Tower, atop a Cliff looking down at the Lake Akkala.</p>
    <p>Shrine Description: Minor Test of Strength</p>
    <p>Hidden?: No</p>
    <p>Shrine Quest?: No</p>

    <p>This shrine does not have a puzzle, but instead, as suggested by the description, is a test of your strength. You will be required to beat a guardian. There are several of these types of shrines, though they vary in difficulty and the guardians do not always have the same weapons. In this test, the guardian will have an axe.</p>
    <p>The axe does a pretty insane amount of damage, so make sure to use a single-handed weapon and parry away from attacks. Once it starts its swing, attack it from the back where it is vulnerable.</p>
    <p>Once the guardian has taken enough damage it will jump back and charge a ranged attack where it spins toward you. Stay behind a pillar. It will hit the pillar and get stunned, which gives you an opportunity to attack.</p>
    <p>Once it has taken enough damage it will move away and begin to charge a ranged lazer attack. Either let it finish this charge and sprint as it is shooting to avoid its shots and attack it while charging or use Stasis to freeze it and attack it.
    <p>On the way out, you can open the chest to get a Giant Ancient Core</p>
    <p>Lastly, talk to the Shrine overseer to get your Spirit Orb and then leave.</p>
